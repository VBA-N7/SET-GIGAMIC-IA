_Example: the 3 cards with black outline form a set._


Based on a keras model generated by [teachable machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) using tensorflow, this script captures continiously frames from a camera to detect which set of card is matching.
**Actually, it is only able to detect shape of all the cards detected on the desk.**
